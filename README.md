Hi, I want to share this simple plugin I make for personal use and learning purposes, it is a space to put short notes (some form of notepad). It is hidden by default use **ALT+ "N"** keys (by default) to unhide/hide or the toolbar button. The notes are persistent via the save button and the interface shows everywhere in the game. I'm not a programmer and this is my very first approach to c# and unity so suggestions are more than welcome. ![:rolleyes:](https://kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)

**0.16** Important: delete old versions prior 0.7 as dir structure of the plugin was changed(Make a backup of your notes) : Recompiled for 1.8.0

The up and down arrows are usable as text scroll, the next/prev buttons works as the buttons in the normal notes interface, and the green arrow will show some vessel info. You can use the rpm format in the notes, ie:

 


This is a test
[hw] half width
<color=#ffffff3e>color test
<color=#f4b541>orange
<color=#4587de>blue
<color=#133a0f>green

```
[dw] double width
```
